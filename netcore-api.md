# Parpera backend engineering test

Create 2 RESTful APIs from scratch. 

Please emphasise on clean code structure and demonstrate good understanding of any design patterns used.

## Criteria
- Use any .netcore framework

- Create a RESTful api that returns the following set of transaction data.
  - the data should be ordered by datetime in descending order

|ID|Datetime|Description|Amount|Status|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|11|2020-09-08'T'16:34:23Z|Bank Deposit|500.00|Completed|

- Create a RESTful api that allows a transaction's status to be updated.

- You do not need to use an external database, you may persist data in memory.

- Appropriate test coverage

## Bonous objectives
- Secure the update API to only allow authenticated users. NOTE: You do not need to issue tokens, simply assume the client has already acquired a valid token.
- Persist the data in an SQL Lite database

## Submission
- Host your project on GitHub
- The application must be built and runnable in VS Code or VS Studio
- include a README with
    - Any instructions or dependencies required to run locally
    - Caveats
